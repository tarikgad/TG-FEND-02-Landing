## Introdcution
This is for Front End Nano Degree within Million Arab Programmers. It's the second project.

## Dependency
I used [Udacity code](https://github.com/tarikgad/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page) for HTML & CSS but took me a day to dig it and understand its structure then adjust in the suitable way for my Javascript code

## Final
The project has **index.html** as the main page then _2 folders_ for [css](css/) & [js](js/)
